# MNTN-Landing-Page

I saw a <a href="https://dev.to/emmanx/free-figma-ui-designs-for-frontend-practice-3ak2" target="_blank">dev.to</a> blog where the author has provided few Figma files. So, I took this opportunity to refresh my CSS skills and built a landing page. As of now, it doesn't have a responsive design and no JS is implemented. But, I'am working on it. ;)
